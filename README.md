# NASA-NEX-DCP30-GEE
A repository for working with NASA NEX DCP30 data within google earth engine (GEE).

Created in collaboration with Alex Francis, current MS Geology student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville & Dr. Christopher Russoniello, Assistant Professor leading the Hydrogeology Lab at the University of Rhode Island (https://cjrusson.wixsite.com/mysite).

## Motivation:
This repository was created to share produced code on how to extract this multi-terabyte dataset for local research applications using GEE. At the time of production (Summer 2022) there was limited methods available to extract this data, let alone methods with a clear description/code to follow. We hope this repository can be of help in your endeavors in downloading/extracting this awesome dataset!

## Dataset Description:
Description taken from https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_NEX-DCP30#description

The NASA NEX-DCP30 dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios for the conterminous United States that are derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5, see Taylor et al. 2012) and across the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see Meinshausen et al. 2011) developed for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The purpose of these datasets is to provide a set of high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions.

The dataset contains monthly projections covering the periods from 1950 through 2005 (Retrospective Run) and from 2006 to 2099 (Prospective Run). It includes downscaled projections from 33 models. Not every scenario contains projections from every model.

NEX-DCP30 was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames Research Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS).
