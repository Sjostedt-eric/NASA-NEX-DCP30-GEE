# NASA-NEX-DCP30-GEE
A repository for working with NASA NEX DCP30 data within google earth engine.

Created in collaboration with Alex Francis, current MS Geology student at University of Tennessee, Knoxville & Dr. Chris Russoniello at Univeristy of Rhode Island.

## Motivation:
This repository was created to share produced code on how to extract this multi-terabyte dataset for local research applications using GEE. At the time of production (Summer 2022) there was limited methods available to extract this data, let alone methods with a clear description/code to follow.
